# Dummy-backend

A ready-to-go REST API compliant server so you can prototype your front end. Just call the endpoint you wish you had and itâ€™s available on the fly.

- No database server to setup
- No web server
- No VM
- No authentication

The server will create tables and records as you need them. You can
create, update, delete, get, list (including query, sorting, pagination) them using standard CRUD requests.

When you're satified with your solution, you can start building the backend that matches your feature and not the opposite.

## Install

Clone this repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:debrice/dummy-backend.git
```

Install the dependencies using `yarn`

```sh
cd dummy-backend
yarn
```

Run the server using `yarn start`

```sh
yarn start
```

## Arguments

The start call accepts the following arguments

| Method   | alias | description                                   | default       |
| -------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| port     | p     | change the serving port                       | 8080          |
| datafile | d     | sets the filename where the data is persisted | database.json |

```
$ yarn start --d foo.json -p 8000
4/2/2020, 8:11:45 PM Serving request at http://localhost:8000
4/2/2020, 8:11:45 PM Loading data from foo.json ...
4/2/2020, 8:11:45 PM Loading data done.
```

## Interactions

By default the server will run on port 8080 on your localhost. The convention is having the table name as the first part of the URL followed by optional ID.

For example, if you want to interact with a users table, use the following URLs:

| Method | URL        | description                             |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| GET    | /users/123 | return the user with ID 123             |
| PUT    | /users/123 | updates the user with ID 123            |
| DELETE | /users/123 | delete the user with ID 123             |
| POST   | /users     | create a user (generate the ID for you) |
| GET    | /users/    | return a list of users (more below)     |

## Listing

Listing often allows for a few additional like, pagination, filtering and sorting.

### Listing query arguments

Every listing endpoint accepts the following query arguments:

| argument      | description                                | example             | default |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------- |
| page          | The page number starting at 0              | ?page=0             | 0       |
| pageSize      | the number of item per page                | ?pageSize=5         | 10      |
| sortBy        | The attribute to sort the listing by       | ?sortBy=createdAt   | -       |
| sortDirection | Sorting direction when sortBy is provided  | ?sortDirection=DESC | ASC     |
| filter_xxx    | Filter record that must contains the value | ?filter_name=john   | -       |

### Listing Response

Since you can provide pagination, it makes sense to have a response that allows you to display proper pagination. A call
to a the listing [endpoint of users](http://localhost:8080/users/?pageSize=2&sortBy=id&sortDirection=DESC) would return:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "email": "what@example.com",
      "name": "John what",
      "id": "f3a0c7c7-b9b0-4f91-a485-a643d653508a",
      "createdAt": "2020-04-02T19:58:26.021Z",
      "updatedAt": "2020-04-02T19:58:26.021Z"
    },
    {
      "email": "what@example.com",
      "name": "John what",
      "id": "f0ccc71e-9411-454d-895a-3dc528e78872",
      "createdAt": "2020-04-02T19:58:38.601Z",
      "updatedAt": "2020-04-02T19:58:38.601Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 10,
  "pageSize": 2,
  "page": 0,
  "sortBy": "id",
  "sortDirection": "DESC"
}
```

## Persistence

By default the database is stored in memory and is backed up to every one seconds in a
file (default to `database.json`).
The database is loaded back in memory when the server starts.
